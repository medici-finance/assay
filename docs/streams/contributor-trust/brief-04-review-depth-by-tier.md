brief: assay:assay:contributor-trust:04
title: "Review depth by tier — an unknown author's pull request gets a claims-versus-diff fact check and a fail-first reproduction"
why: >-
  The one thing that was provably wrong in the first unsolicited arrivals here was a body
  claim: "fixed, all tests pass", asserted without being checked, on a pull request whose diff
  did not support it. Review today reads an unknown author's description with the same
  credence as a maintainer's, which is exactly the assumption those arrivals disproved. Making
  depth a function of tier costs a known contributor nothing and puts the cheapest possible
  control — read each claim, check it against the diff, say which ones you could not confirm —
  in front of the submissions where claims are least likely to have been verified.

# Brief 04 — Review depth by tier

## Context

files:
- `tools/desk/internal/deskkit/reviewlanes.go` (new) — `LanesFor(tier) []Lane`, pure, table-
  driven from the per-tier capability table, plus the claims-extraction helper the fact-check
  lane is dispatched with.
- `tools/desk/internal/deskkit/reviewlanes_test.go` (new).
- `tools/desk/cmd/deskdispatch/references/review-lanes.md` (new) — the lane set per tier and
  the fact-check lane's output contract, as a dispatch reference.
- `plugins/assay/skills/pr-review-desk/SKILL.md` — one paragraph: lane depth is tier-keyed;
  the tier source is a project-layer value the neutral body resolves, not a value inlined
  here.
- `changelog/contributor-trust-review-depth.md` (new).

facts:
- Lane set by tier. `unknown` and `blessed-once`: correctness at strong tier, the security
  lane, a claims-versus-diff fact check, and a mandatory fail-first reproduction. `contributor`
  and `maintainer`: the standard path, unchanged from today.
- The claims-versus-diff fact check enumerates every assertion the pull-request body makes and
  returns, per claim, one of `confirmed` (the diff or a run supports it), `contradicted` (the
  diff or a run disproves it), or `unverified` (it could not be checked from the change
  alone). Every claim gets exactly one, and `unverified` is a legitimate, expected outcome —
  it is not a failure and must never be rounded to `confirmed`.
- The fail-first reproduction requires the reviewer to demonstrate the reported problem before
  the change: run the failing case at the merge base and record it failing, then at the head
  and record it passing. A change whose problem cannot be reproduced at the base is reported
  as such, not merged around.
- A `contradicted` claim is a review finding on its own, independent of whether the diff is
  correct. The claim, not only the code, is what the reviewer answers.
- Lane selection is the only thing that varies. The verdict shape, the reviewer identity, the
  ready flip and the merge authority are unchanged.
- Risk answers, against the declared paths: `tools/desk/internal/deskkit/` is a security-trigger
  path, and all four answers are nevertheless `no`. The reason is that this brief only ADDS
  lanes for the lowest tiers and changes no predicate that admits, authorizes or writes — the
  tier it reads is produced by `contributor-trust/02`, which carries the human gate for the
  authority question. The failure direction here is a review that is too shallow for a known
  contributor, which the review gate itself catches; it cannot widen what anyone may do.
- This brief is inert until a ledger exists: with no ledger every external identity is
  `unknown`, so external pull requests get the deep lane and internal ones are unaffected.

## Ground rules
- NEVER git push / trigger workflows / run mutating kubectl. Leave commits per the task
  instructions only.
- Stop at `implemented` — you do not set verified/done.
- If anything is unclear or contradicts repo state: report NEEDS_CONTEXT, don't guess.
- Never build, test or execute an unblessed pull-request head as part of this work, including
  in a fixture. The fail-first reproduction is a lane the reviewer runs under the existing
  blessing rules; this brief defines it and does not run it.

## Task

1. `reviewlanes.go`: the tier-to-lane table and `LanesFor`. Table-driven, so the whole policy
   is readable in one place.
2. The claims-extraction helper and the three-state per-claim result type, with the invariant
   that every extracted claim carries exactly one state and `unverified` is representable.
3. The dispatch reference: the lane set per tier, the fact-check output contract, and the
   fail-first reproduction's two required records (base failing, head passing).
4. One paragraph in the review-desk skill body, written neutrally so it carries no house
   value.
5. The changelog fragment.

Pre-mortem to detection map. "Every tier silently gets the deep lane, so the change is a
blanket slowdown nobody asked for" is caught by row 3, the negative control. "A claim the
reviewer could not check is recorded as confirmed, which is the exact failure the lane exists
to prevent" is caught by rows 4 and 5. "The fail-first reproduction is described as 'reproduce
the bug' with no requirement to record the base run, so a reviewer records only the head
passing" is caught by row 7. "The skill-body paragraph inlines a house value into a neutral
body" is caught by row 9. "The fact-check lane enumerates claims badly — it finds three of a
body's seven assertions" — no row; extraction quality is a review-gate judgement, and the
contract only requires that every claim it does extract carries a state.
