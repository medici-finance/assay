## Verify (executable — no prose-only DoD items)
| # | Command | Expect |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | `go test ./...` | exit 0 |
| 2 | `go test ./integration/...` | exit 0 |

## Evidence
<!-- contract comment -->

| # | Command | Exit | Result | Date | Runner |
|---|---------|------|--------|------|--------|
